Here are a few sample projects that previous Catapult students as well as Rose
students have developed. 

# Catapult 2019: Beat Fighter

This is a game developed by three Catapult students in the summer of 2019 where
a player has to punch objects that come in different directions, according to a
song's beat. Exciting!

# Catapult 2019: Catch'em pearls

<img class="center" width="480" height="360" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pearls.gif" />

This is another game designed by students in the summer 2019 catapult session.
In this game, the player must collect as many pearls as possible while avoiding
water bottles and floating coke bottles. Obviously, I suck at this game, but
it's a lot of fun!


# CSSE 120: Fall 2020-21

This is one of my favorite projects designed by two of my CSSE120 students in
the Fall of 2020/21. The students are Richie Eaddie and Thomas Yang. They not
only delivered a great working street fighting game, they also thought of a very
creative and hilarious way to share their work!
