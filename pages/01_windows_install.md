# Python Installation: Windows

If you already have python installed on your machine, please check its version
by simply typing `python` in a command line terminal. If the version number you
see is > 3, then you are good to go. Otherwise, if you have python 2.x, then you
need to install python3 according to the following instructions. 

## Download the installer

Download the python3 install from [this
link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe)

## Run the installer

Run the installer by double clicking on it. 

1. On the first screen, click on `Install Now`. **However,** make note of the
   location where Python is being installed, you might need this later!
2. You should now see a green bar that is starting to fill out. Wait for it!
   Python is being installed.
3. If all goes well, you should see a screen that says `Setup was successful`.
   Click on the `Close` button on the bottom right. You are now good to go!
4. If you encountered any issues during this installation, then please reach out
   to your instructor or teaching assistant for help!
