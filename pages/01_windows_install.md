# Python Installation: Windows

If you already have python installed on your machine, please check its version
by simply typing `python` in a command line terminal. If the version number you
see is > 3, then you are good to go. Otherwise, if you have python 2.x, then you
need to install python3 according to the following instructions. 

## Download the installer

Download the python3 install from [this
link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/python-3.9.5-amd64.exe)

## Run the installer

Run the installer by double clicking on it. 

1. On the first screen, click on `Install Now`. **However,** make note of the
   location where Python is being installed, you might need this later!
