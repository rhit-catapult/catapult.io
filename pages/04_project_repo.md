# Project Repos

For each project, we will create a repository to host all of your code and we
will give each member of the teams access to the repo so you can all take it
home with you. 

To do so, please accept the following assignment invite by clicking on this

When you get to the team selection page, please make sure that __only one member
of the group creates the group__ and the rest of you join that group.
