# Installing PyCharm: All platforms

If you have not yet installed python and git, then please go back to that tutorial
and make sure that both are installed before continuing with this setup guide. 

In this project, we will be using the PyCharm Community edition IDE, which is a
powerful tool that allows us to write python programs with ease. 

## Download the installer

First step is for us to download the installer as usual:
- [For
Windows](https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2021.1.2.exe?_gl=1*1xfurov*_ga*MjM3MTk0MjYuMTYwMDQzOTM4OA..*_ga_V0XZL7QHEB*MTYyMzQyOTg0Ny4zLjEuMTYyMzQyOTg2MC4w)
- [For
MacOS](https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2021.1.2.dmg?_gl=1*ndny6n*_ga*MjM3MTk0MjYuMTYwMDQzOTM4OA..*_ga_V0XZL7QHEB*MTYyMzQyOTg0Ny4zLjEuMTYyMzQyOTg5MS4w)
- [For
Linux](https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-community-2021.1.2.tar.gz?_gl=1*xfm1a*_ga*MjM3MTk0MjYuMTYwMDQzOTM4OA..*_ga_V0XZL7QHEB*MTYyMzQyOTg0Ny4zLjEuMTYyMzQyOTkyNy4w)



## Install PyCharm: Windows

If you are on Windows, then let's get working on installing PyCharm for
you. 

1. Run the installer that you have downloaded, you should see a menu that looks
   as follows:

   ![PyCharm Install 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/00.png)

   Let's go ahead and click on `Next`, and then leave the default option for the
   next screen, as shown below, and then click on `Next`.

   ![PyCharm Install 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/01.png)

2. On the following screen, check the boxes next to `64-bit launcher`, `Add
    launchers dir to PATH` and `.py`, as shown in the screenshot below

   ![PyCharm Install 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/02.png)

3. Next, let go ahead and click on the `Install` button shown below

   ![PyCharm Install 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/03.png)

4. After the installation completes, click the radio button next to `I want to
   manually reboot later` and then click on `Finish`

   ![PyCharm Install 5]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/04.png)

5. Let's go ahead and verify our installation, launch PyCharm, accept the
   license and then you should see a screen that looks like the following

   ![PyCharm Install 6]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/PycharmInstallWin/05.png)

## Install PyCharm: MacOS

On MacOS, the process is much simpler. Double click on the file you downloaded,
and then simply drag the PyCharm icon into the Applications folder, and you are
all set. 

## Install PyCharm: Linux

For Linux users, no installation is required. Simply extract the compressed file
that you downloaded and then open a terminal, navigate to the directory you
extracted the folder to, and type `./pycharm.sh`. If you need help to navigate
the terminal, then please reach out to you instructor or teaching assistant.
