Welcome to the first session of Operation Catapult, I am very excited to work
with you and to help you develop your first (or maybe not?) Python programming
project.  Python is a powerful programming language that is easy to learn, and
it is rapidly growing in popularity both as a first language and as a language
in which to accomplish complex tasks. We encourage two kinds of students to
choose this project:
1. If you have never programmed before, this introductory project is for you! We
   will spend the first few days doing classroom and lab instruction on the
   basics of Python programming, aimed at students with little or no programming
   experience.
2. Second, if you already know another programming language, but your high
   school does not offer Python, this is a great opportunity to learn this
   language and do an exciting project; you may work at a faster pace than the
   new programmers if you wish.

In this project, we will:
- Learn the basics of coding in Python (variables, functions, loops, classes,
  etc.)
- Go from complete Python noobs to developing our own video game!
- Learn and experience the software engineering design and implementation life
  cycle
- Most importantly, HAVE FUN! and build and exciting project. 

You can find a sample of previous projects on this 
[page]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/00_samples).

<!--
If you sign up for the Python programming project, it is okay to delay the
choice of the  specific kind of program your team will write after you have
learned more about Python’s capabilities. You may even delay final team
selection if you wish.  Once our project sessions begin and everyone is learning
Python, you’ll be able to switch teams so as to team up with other students
whose interests and programming experience (or lack of it) are similar to yours.
Note that all of the software tools we will use are free, so it will be easy for
you to take your project home and continue to enhance it after Catapult ends.
Maybe get your friends at home interested in working with you.  A former
Catapulter did so – he and his friend worked on their own as seniors, and then
jarned credit for the first CSSE course when they came to Rose!
